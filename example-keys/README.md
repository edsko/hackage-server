This directory contains example keys which you can use for testing. The TUF
metadata files datafiles/TUF/{root,mirrors}.json are created using these keys,
and the keys datafiles/TUF/{snapshot,timestamp}.private as copies of these keys.

IMPORTANT: These keys should only be used for testing; for other purposes you
should create your own keys. See section "Setting up security infrastructure"
of the main README for more detail.
