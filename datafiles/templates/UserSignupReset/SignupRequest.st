<h2>Register a new account</h2>

<p>Certain actions on this website require you to have an account.
In particular you need an account to be able to upload or help maintain packages.

<p>Using the form below you can register an account. Note however that getting
permission to upload packages requires an extra step from an administrator.

<form class="box" action="/users/register-request" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">

<table>
<tr>
<td><label for="realname">Your name</label>
<td><input type="text" name="realname" id="realname">
<td>This is what will be displayed on the site, e.g. Jan Novák

<tr>
<td><label for="username">Login username</label>
<td><input type="text" name="username" id="username">
<td>This has to be ASCII with no spaces, e.g. JanNovak

<tr>
<td><label for="email">Your email address</label>
<td><input type="text" name="email" id="email">
<td>e.g. jnovak@example.com (but do <b>not</b> use the style "Jan Novák" &lt;jnovak@example.com&gt;)
</table>

<p>Your email address will be used to confirm your account (and if you ever
need to reset your password). It will also be used if one of the site
administrators ever needs to contact you. It will not be displayed on
the website (but note that email addresses in .cabal files that you
upload are public).

<p>Most contributors to Hackage attach their real name to their packages and
contributions. However, we have no wish to discourage contributors with
personal or professional reasons for wanting pseudonymity. We ask only that
such people choose a name (and username) that looks at home among a collection
of real names; we will be unwilling to add Kittenlover97 to the package
uploader group.

<p><input type="submit" value="Request account">

<p>You will be sent an email containing a link to a page where you
can set your password and activate your account.
